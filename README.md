# Happy Thoughts

The assignment this week was to build a Twitter-like app where happy thoughts could be posted and displayed.

## The problem

An API was set up for us to use so that we could both fetch and post thoughts to it, and we used the useState and useEffect hooks to make it all work.

Update: During week 19 we created our own APIs to fetch and post thoughts from/to.
